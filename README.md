# 3D-Renderer 🚀

Welcome to **3D-Renderer**, a custom-built 3D rendering engine that brings your geometric visuals to life! Dive into the world of ray tracing, shading, and rendering techniques with this project.

## 🌟 Features
- **Customizable Camera** 🎥: Easily adjust camera position and orientation.
- **Ray Tracing** 🌈: Simulate realistic light interactions with objects, producing shadows, reflections, and more.
- **Phong Shading** 💡: Approximate light reflection with the Phong model for a smooth, realistic appearance.
- **Anti-Aliasing** 🖌️: Supersampling to reduce jagged edges and create smoother visuals.
- **Real-time Preview** ⏱️: Visualize changes instantly as you tweak rendering settings.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- **React** & **Three.js**: UI and 3D rendering framework.
- **JavaScript**: Core logic and algorithms.
- **CSS/Tailwind**: Styled components for a sleek interface.
- **Framer Motion**: Animated transitions for a smooth user experience.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (v14+)
- **npm** or **yarn**

### Installation
1. **Clone the repo**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/devKanix/3D-Renderer.git
   cd 3D-Renderer
2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
3. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev


### Usage
- **Adjust Camera Settings**: Modify the camera props in StarsCanvas for different perspectives.
- **Customize Lights**: Change the light intensity and position for different effects.
- **Modify 3D Models**: Add or modify objects in the scene using Three.js.

## Concepts Covered
- **Ray-Sphere Intersection**: Calculate if and where rays intersect with spheres.
- **Phong Illumination Model**: Simulate ambient, diffuse, and specular reflections.
- **Recursive Ray Tracing**: Trace rays for reflections and refractions.

## Prerequisites for 3D Rendering
**To get started with 3D rendering concepts, it’s helpful to have a basic understanding of**:
- Vector mathematics (dot product, cross product).
- Light reflection and refraction.
- Ray tracing and shading models.
